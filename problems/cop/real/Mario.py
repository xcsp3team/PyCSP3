""" Comments
1) Note that the code below, when building the table is more compact than:
 [(s[i], f[i]) in [(j, houses[i].fuelConsumption[j]) for j in range(len(houses[i].fuelConsumption))] for i in range(nHouses)],
 or [(s[i], f[i]) in [(j, fuel) for j, fuel in enumerate(houses[i].fuelConsumption)] for i in range(nHouses)],

2) Note that introducing auxiliary variables for handling gold earned at each house could be as follows:
 # g[i] is the gold earned at house i
 g = VarArray(size=nHouses, dom=lambda i: {0, houses[i].gold})
 
  We need to introduce additional constraints, while the objective becomes:
 maximize(
   # maximizing collected gold
   Sum(g)
 )
